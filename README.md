Summary:
  'During the optimization process, the performance, readability, and scalability of the original query were significantly improved. This was achieved through query refactoring and indexing.
Refactoring made the query easier to read and understand, while also providing a slight improvement in execution performance. Indexes eliminated full table scans, allowing the database engine to locate data more efficiently. As a result, overall query performance was greatly enhanced.'
